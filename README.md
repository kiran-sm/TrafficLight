# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Problem-Statement

Build a traffic light where the lights switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Each light should be lit for the following durations:

Red light: 4000ms
Yellow light: 500ms
Green light: 3000ms
You are free to exercise your creativity to style the appearance of the traffic light.
